## UK Excise Requirement
___
Alcohol Excise is a tax applied to alcoholic beverages. (EG Beer)

By default the product becomes liable for excise when it is packaged for resale (cask, tin or bottle). The cost of the excise is passed on to the consumer in the price. 

Most breweries will apply to HMRC (the tax authority) for a suspension - meaning that duty only becomes payable when the product leaves the premesis. In this case it is very important that product on which duty has been paid is kept separately identifiable from product on which duty has not been paid. This might happen if product leaves the premesis but the delivery fails. This is generally handled by putting duty paid beer in a separate area (location)

Product may be sold to a wholesaler duty-free. In this case the sale is refered to as duty in suspense. The amount of excise suspended should be calculated in the records.

Excise may form the larger part of the cost of inventory (for duty-paid product) and the cost of sales. These facts should be reflected in the accounts. However the Excise should be kept separate from the general inventory valuation as it is reported separately. 

If the product is faulty and returned for disposal the amount of the disposal should be recorded so that the excise can be reclaimed.
